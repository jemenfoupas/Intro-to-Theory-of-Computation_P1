# Project 1
Authors: Rich Boundji & Ethan Raygor

In this project we implemented the DFA and DFAState classes. These classes along with the given DFADriver class and a properly formatted test file will make a DFA and test 5 given strings to see if they are accepted by the created DFA.

The following files were provided for us:
fa.dfa.DFADriver.java
fa.dfa.SFAInterface.java
fa.FAInterface.java
fa.State.java

The following files were implemented by us:
fa.dfa.DFA.java
fa.dfa.DFAState.java

The following files were used as tests cases:
tests.p1tc*.txt

Compilation:
`javac fa/*.java`
`javac fa/dfa/*.java`

Running (Example uses text case 1):
java fa/dfa/DFADriver ./tests/p1tc1.txt

There are no known bugs in this project.
